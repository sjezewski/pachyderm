## ./pachctl commit

Docs for commits.

### Synopsis


Commits are atomic transactions on the content of a repo.

Creating a commit is a multistep process:
- start a new commit with start-commit
- write files to it through fuse or with put-file
- finish the new commit with finish-commit

Commits that have been started but not finished are NOT durable storage.
Commits become reliable (and immutable) when they are finished.

Commits can be created with another commit as a parent.
This layers the data in the commit over the data in the parent.

```
./pachctl commit
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -v, --verbose   Output verbose logs
```
