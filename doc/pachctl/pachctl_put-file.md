## ./pachctl put-file

Put a file into the filesystem.

### Synopsis


Put-file supports a number of ways to insert data into pfs:
Put data from stdin as repo/commit/path:
	echo "data" | pachctl put-file repo commit path

Start a new commmit on branch, put data from stdin as repo/branch/path and
finish the commit:
	echo "data" | pachctl put-file -c repo branch path

Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/commit/path:
	pachctl put-file repo commit path -f file

Put a file from the local filesystem as repo/commit/file:
	pachctl put-file repo commit -f file

Put the contents of a directory as repo/commit/path/dir/file:
	pachctl put-file -r repo commit path -f dir

Put the contents of a directory as repo/commit/dir/file:
	pachctl put-file -r repo commit -f dir

Put the data from a URL as repo/commit/path:
	pachctl put-file repo commit path -f http://host/path

Put the data from a URL as repo/commit/path:
	pachctl put-file repo commit -f http://host/path

Put several files or URLs that are listed in file.
Files and URLs should be newline delimited.
	pachctl put-file repo commit -i file

Put several files or URLs that are listed at URL.
NOTE this URL can reference local files, so it could cause you to put sensitive
files into your Pachyderm cluster.
	pachctl put-file repo commit -i http://host/path


```
./pachctl put-file repo-name commit-id path/to/file/in/pfs
```
